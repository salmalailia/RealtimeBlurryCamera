## Goals
-Create a Realtime Blurring Camera
  Vloggers and Live Streamers are on the rise these days.
  When they take a video, inevitably someone else is taken.
  Therefore, we wanted to implement a function that automatically hides the faces of other people besides the registered ones.

## What We Did
-Create a registration process
  Take multi-directional face photos of the person you wish to register
  Train the AI with those photos

-Create and test the blurring code
  When viewing a registered user, it does not blur and outputs the name
  Blur unregistered users
